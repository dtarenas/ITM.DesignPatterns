#### *Pattern:* Factory Method
#### *Scenario:* The ReserApp notifications module requires sending notifications of reservation management and incoming packages through different ways of notification such as WhatsApp, Email and Push
#### *Problem:* Each notification way has a different implementation, for example, WhatsApp must consume the Meta's API for WhatsApp, Email requires access to the SMTP server and Push requires connection to a third party service such as Firebase

#### *Scenario:* A hamburger restaurant released a menu with two types of burgers, Traditional and Vegetarian, however, added the option to allow the customer can create his own burger by adding the ingredients of his choice.

#### *Problem:* The customer decides to create a new custom hamburger
