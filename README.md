### *Pattern:* Factory Method
#### *Scenario:* The ReserApp notifications module requires sending notifications of reservation management and incoming packages through different ways of notification such as WhatsApp, Email and Push
#### *Problem:* Each notification way has a different implementation, for example, WhatsApp must consume the Meta's API for WhatsApp, Email requires access to the SMTP server and Push requires connection to a third party service such as Firebase

### *Pattern:* Builder
#### *Scenario:* A hamburger restaurant released a menu with two types of burgers, Traditional and Vegetarian, however, added the option to allow the customer can create his own burger by adding the ingredients of his choice. Note: When customizing the burger, an additional 10% of the cost of the ingredient is applied
#### *Problem:* The customer decides to create a new custom hamburger

### *Pattern:* Proxy
#### *Scenario:* ReserApp exposes the Common Area service via API
#### *Problem:* The service takes about 3 seconds to respond per request and the user perceives the application as slow

### *Pattern:* Adapter
#### *Scenario:* ReserApp is using a free reporting library that will deprecated during the second half of 2024, and this must be replaced by a new paid library that will provide support for as long as its license is paid
#### *Problem:* There are currently 35 reports that should not be affected in the migration process to the new library
